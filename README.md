4. Add a quick reflection(2 sentences) about what was difficult __The things that were most difficult for me while making this cookie simulator were getting the global clicks to increase everytime you would click on the cookie. And another thing was getting the audio to download and put back on the project so in the end all I did was add an AI voice to say "Here Goes Kyrie" to match with my project.__
